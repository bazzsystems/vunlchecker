This code is a simple IP scanner that allows the user to enter an IP address or a domain name, and then shows a list of open ports, vulnerabilities, and whether the IP address has a firewall. The scanner is run in a graphical user interface (GUI) that is created using the tkinter module, and the actual scanning is performed using the socket module. The results of the scan are displayed in the GUI and written to a file called scan_results.txt.
